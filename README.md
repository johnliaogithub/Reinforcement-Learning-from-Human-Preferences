john: 
 - csv files from hdf5
     - challenge: mujoco doesn't label their data
     - first time plotted, column headers were incorrect (shifted left by 1)
 - show plots
 - show metric: distances & total distance

next steps: 
 - include angle, IOU metrics, total trajectory distance, shaking a lot (mean absolute acceleration)
